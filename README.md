## About the Video Course
	Companies value their data; as a result, it's becoming more important for professionals to have technical knowledge of data management. PostgreSQL is by far one of the most popular and powerful SQL engines among other platforms such as MariaDB, MySQL, and SQL Server.

IBM Watson has evolved from being a game show winning question & answering computer system to a set of enterprise-grade artificial intelligence (AI) application program interfaces (API) available on IBM Cloud. These Watson API’s can ingest, understand & analyze all forms of data, allow for natural forms of interactions with people, learn, reason - all at a scale that allows for business processes and applications to be reimagined. 

This course will give you a hands-on introduction to getting a detailed understanding of the Watson AI API’s, how to train them and eventually build applications using them. You will go through the fundamentals behind each of the API’s, lots of code examples on how to use them on different types of unstructured data, spot the scenarios where you can apply them as well as real-life use case examples. You will learn about how to build conversational apps a.k.a., chat-bots, analyze text at a deeper level, transcribe audio, training a machine to classify & detect objects in pictures, extract entities, emotions, sentiment and relationships from news articles etc. 

You will also learn the different types of data basics of AI including machine & deep learning, approach to building AI systems. You will learn about the basics of getting started with IBM Cloud, Watson and setting up an environment to build AI infused apps.

By the end of the course, you will have a complete understanding of the various Watson API’s and will have developed the skills to effectively use them in applications and business processes you may be working on.
